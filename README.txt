SafeRoute is a session-based route tracking system.

Added contacts can follow along on a map session, and users are automatically marked safe at arrival.

* Entire route is shown and mapped at the end of the trip
* Check what mode of transportation is being used
* Auto notifications when trip goes over the expected time, deviates from the expected route, or stays in the same spot too long
* Send alert to user to check in if any of these events occur
* Time customization for notifications
* Saved history of previous routes
* Route predictions from previously saved --> offer scheduled route option
* Estimate expected time and optimal route through Google Maps data
